IceChat 9.5 is coded using Visual Studio 2017 with .NET 4.5.2. 

Unzip the file into any folder. It is best to use My Documents and not the Program Files folder, because of permissions issues.

There is an BuildIceChat.4.5.cmd file in the build folder which will build IceChat 9.5.

You can double click the file, and it will open a command window.

A new folder called IceChatBuild will be created, and once the batch file has completed, 4 files will be placed in this folder.

Copy these 4 files into your IceChat installation/Program Files folder, or place them anywhere else you want.

To see all the changes from build to build, read the changelog.txt file in the src\IceChat folder.
